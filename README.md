Practised SpringBoot by making a TODO App which performs CRUD operations along with database connectivity (MySQL) with frontend in React using Vite.

Methods used PUT, POST, DELETE, GET

Learned about different layers in SpringBoot application like :- controller, service layer, hibernate layer

> controller calls the function in service layer
> service layer used for writing logic 
> hibernate to communicate with database
