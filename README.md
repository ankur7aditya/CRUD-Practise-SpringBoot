# To-Do App  

A simple To-Do application built with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React (Vite)** for the frontend. The app performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and connects to a **MySQL** database.

  - **POST**: Add new tasks  
  - **GET**: Retrieve tasks  
  - **PUT**: Update existing tasks  
  - **DELETE**: Remove tasks

  - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.  
  - **Hibernate Layer**: Manages communication with the database.
